BrainTools
===========

What is it?
------------
An utility for working with Brainfuck and related languages. Can encode and decode programs in various
formats.

What works?
------------
Currently, not much =] You can experiment with the code yourself to see what's what.
Basically, you can run Brainfuck programs.
Also, you can decode Brainloller images into Brainfuck code (and then run it).
__UPDATE:__ Now you can encode Brainfuck programs into images using Braincopter (and then decode them back).

What next?
-----------
1. Finish writing the Braincopter encoder and decoder.
2. Write Brainfuck and Brainloller encoders.
3. Make the utility actually work.
4. ?????
5. PROFIT!!!!!!~
